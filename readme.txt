- This game is inspired by a Chinese story (桃花源记). This is a story about a fisherman who stumbled 
across a beautiful peach forest, with villagers who clearly do not have contact with the outside world.
This game is an exploration game where the player is able to explore the land randomly generated by the 
algorithm and enjoy the beauty of generation.
At the end of the game, the player can take a picture of the scenery, and make it into a postcard by 
adding different filters to the photo. The player
Users can also save the photo under the name "postcard.png" in the same folder as the game.

- In order to use the postcard-making feature, the user must allow vscode to take
screenshots. This can be set up under the privacy settings. In order to run the 
project, the user can compile the main.py file. 

- Libraries and modules I have used: math, random, cmu_112_graphics, 
from pygame.locals import *, from pygame import mixer.
