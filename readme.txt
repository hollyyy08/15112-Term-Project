- This game is inspired by a Chinese ancient story about a fisherman who stumbled 
across a beautiful peach forest,with villegers that claerly does not have contact 
with the outside world.
This game is an exploration game where the player is able to explore the land randonly generated by the algorithm, and enjoy the beauty of generation.
At the end of the game, the player can take a picture of the scenery, and make it into a postcard by adding different filters onto the photo. The player
can also save the photo under the name "postcard.png" in the same folder as the game.

- In order to use the postcard making feature, the user must allow vscode to take
screenshots. This can be set up under the privacy settings. In order to run the 
project, the user can compile the main.py file. 

- Libraries and modules I have used: math, random, cmu_112_graphics, 
from pygame.locals import *, from pygame import mixer.
